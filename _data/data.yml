career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: In broad terms, my work falls under the field of computational social science. More specifically, I specialise in evolutionary anthropology. Over the past few years, I have approached the evolution of human social organisation and behavioural patterns from a behavioural ecology perspective, particularly focusing on their role in the transition from small, simple communities to large, complex societies. At the same time, I actively embrace interdisciplinary approaches. I enjoy engaging with perspectives from other disciplines to deepen my understanding of human behaviour and social structures. I am also open to exploring and adopting innovative scientific methods to enhance my research.

        time: 2020-2024
        details: |
          During my PhD, my broad research interests have centred on the evolution of cooperation and religion, and how these two fundamental concepts are associated with each other. I analyse social network data and demographic data, as well as use mathematical modelling, to explore the benefits of religious practices. During this time, I have published four papers in SCI journals as the lead author, marking significant milestones in this intellectual journey.

          During my master's degree in ecology at Lanzhou University, which I entered through a recommendation-based admission,I worked under the supervision of Professor Ruth Mace (Fellow of the British Academy). My research focused on the evolution of human cooperative behaviour using statistical modelling. I published one SCI article as the first author and awarded a National Graduate Scholarship.
